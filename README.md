# angular2-simple-start
Angular 2 starter project with Gulp build process, Bootstrap, and TypeScript

A collection of my own efforts to learn and understand Angular2 and the relevant tools required to set up a development workflow on which to build a professional application. This is a work in progress as Angular2 evolves and I get up to speed with the framework, best practices, TypeScript, necessary libraries, and tooling.

Goal is to have a dev workflow that provides for Angular2 and TypeScript best practices, and compiles to minified, production-ready artifacts that are immediately servable. Both minified (production) and non-minified with full sourcemaps (dev) workflows should be handled.

Also includes an Express server configured for serving the final builds, but the /dist folder contents can be exported to any server.

The basic starter app itself is similar to that described in the Angular2 (angular.io) quickstart and tutorial. My emphasis is mainly on growing a scalable workflow and architecture, beyond toy demos and how-to's.
